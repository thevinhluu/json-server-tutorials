### JSON Server

 * What and Why?
  - Json server is an npm package that lets you create fake REST APIs with zero coding
  - As a front end developer, I constantly need mock data that I can user quickly prototype front end components
  - Data should be fetched asynchronously and the APIs should support not just GET but also POST, PUT and DELETE requests
  - Creating a node + express + mongodb backend is pretty time consuming
